# Segment Anything Model in Multi-Backend Keras

This is an implementation of the Segment Anything model in Keras Core.

The model currently runs in TensorFlow, Jax, and PyTorch, and supports inference.
Check out the [multi-backend Keras demo](Segment_Anything_multi_backend_Keras_Demo.ipynb)
notebook to see how to use the model for inference and port weights from PyTorch.

This project is still a WIP and will be merged with KerasCV in the future.
