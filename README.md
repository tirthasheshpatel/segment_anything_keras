# Segment Anything Model in Multi-Backend Keras

This is an implementation of the Segment Anything model in Keras Core.

The model currently runs in TensorFlow, Jax, and PyTorch, and supports inference.

Check out the demos for using the model and porting over the weights from PyTorch:

- [Predictor demo](Segment_Anything_multi_backend_Keras_Demo.ipynb)
- [Atomatic Mask Generator demo](Segment_Anything_Automatic_Mask_Generator_Demo.ipynb)


**Note: This project will be merged with KerasCV in the future.**
